# Background
This is my first personal website, engineered and designed to express my character and demonstrate my competency. 
It has been a real work-in-progress experience, failing and learning to make different technologies work together to create something that represents me.

## Usage
To use, click on the GitHub deployment link of the website, browse, and interact as you wish!


# Future Updates
- Refine design and presentation of project information
- Expand about me section
- Find better solution for cube!
- How can I make sure that my website doesnâ€™t take in any corrupt data through the contact sheet
- Find solution for deploying website publicly without introducing vulnerabilities to my personal information
