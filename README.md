# Background
This is my first personal website, engineered and designed to express my character and demonstrate my competency. It has been a real work-in-progress experience, failing and learning to make different technologies work together to create something that represents me.

## Usage
To use, click on the website's GitHub deployment link, browse, and interact as you wish!

# Future Updates
- Add onClick functionality to portfolio projects which would take you to GitHub repository (Later this feature would take you to a different "page"
- Expand the About Me section to include experience
- Better implementation of Tree.js to have 3D image on landing home page
