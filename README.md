# Background
This is my first personal website, engineered and designed to express my character and demonstrate my competency. It has been a real work-in-progress experience, failing and learning to make different technologies work together to create something that represents me.

## Usage
To use, click on the GitHub deployment link of the website, browse, and interact as you wish!


# Future Updates
- Add onClick functionality to portfolio projects
- Refine design and presentation of project information
- Expand about me section
- Find better solution for cube!
